# Reader control that follows whatever is on screen.
# Usage: auto.sh <command> [args...]
#
# Commands:
#   next_page         - Turn to next page
#   prev_page         - Turn to previous page
#   next_page_tap     - Next page, tapping the screen on the native reader
#   prev_page_tap     - Previous page, tapping the screen on the native reader
#   brightness <n>    - Adjust frontlight (positive=up, negative=down)
#   brightness_toggle - Toggle frontlight off/on
#   menu              - KOReader menu, native toolbar
#
# KOReader answers on its HTTP Inspector port when it is up, so a delivered
# event means it is the reader in front of you. Trying it is the probe — a
# separate one would only cost another curl. Everything else, including the
# native-only commands (home, back, toolbar), goes to kindle.sh. The tap
# variants only change how the native side turns the page, KOReader still gets
# the HTTP event.
